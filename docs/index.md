### Core principles of Crusher
<CrusherFeatures/>


P.S.- QA = Devs who focuses on testing


### Mission

- Making life of devs easier. Instead of fixing bugs or shipping slowly, they can focus on things that matter and rejuvenate.

- Increasing confidence to ship. Making deploying on friday cool again.

- Making testing cool, it's currently boring, flaky. No one wants to do it yet.


### Opinionated

We're opinionated in certain way, Testing is already too complex, there are tons of slugs for simplest of things

For eg- Black box testing, sanity testing, smoke testing, regression testing, e2e testing, etc.

It's like we have tried to make ecosystem complex, it's more or less the same stuff. And we're here to change it.
