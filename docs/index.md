### Core principles of Crusher
<CrusherFeatures/>

### Mission

- Making the life of devs easier: Instead of writing tests, write code.

- Increasing confidence to ship: We're making sure that you're always on the right track.

- Making testing cool: Currently, it's both boring and flaky.


### Opinionated

We're opinionated in a certain way, Testing is already too complex, there are tons of slugs for the simplest of things. For example, black box testing, sanity testing, regression testing, e2e testing, smoke testing etc.

It's like we're trying to make the ecosystem complex, when it's more or less the same stuff. We want to change this
