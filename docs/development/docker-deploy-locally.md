We want to make it super easy for anyone to install Crusher locally. This is the best option if you're looking to try Crusher locally.

This might not be stable. As this has not been looked on for slightly long time.
Deployment process for services such as crusher-app, etc has changed.

#### Requirement

Make sure you've machine with 3 vCPU and 4GB RAM available (minimum).

Recommened - 4 vCPU and 4GB RAM available (minimum).

## Steps to deploy using docker

Before starting, make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and git installed.

1.) Clone git repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/crusherdev/crusher-docker-deploy.git
```

##### With Postgres/Redis

2.) Start the containers.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

##### Without Postgres/Redis

2.) Change `.env` file and the start the container using

```shell
source .env && docker compose -f docker-compose-plain.yml up
```

3.) Wait for all container to spin up, check status with `docker ps`

4.) (Optional) Point crusher config for endpoint.

P.S.- It's not recommended to deploy Crusher in CI as it's stateful application.
