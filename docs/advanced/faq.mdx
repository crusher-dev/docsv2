### Common question

:::note Why is it in beta?
Crusher is etremely ambitious project. We're trying to own and make in testing better, whether it's library owned by us or built by someone else.

:::


:::note What'll be the pricing?
We're not sure TBH. Current ecosystem discourages testing and innovation.
On rough estimate, pricing we'll start from 35$/user + additional resources.

P.S.- Crusher will always be open source and free for team < 3 people.

:::note Why do I need to join discord community?

We're going to make mistake as we improve DX and do optimization e2e. We need you tell us where we suck and how we can improve.
:::


:::note Who's this for? Developers, QA, etc.

We hate this seggregation. Writing anything can be tough even with good tools.
We're not replacing tester, etc. We're building better framework for them.

At Crusher everyone is a builder, I started coding by using Web expression 4. I thought I was a good developers, but implementing testing seemed tough to me.
